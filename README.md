# com.paul.3rd-person-rpg-input

Using New Input, this is a default configuration for my 3rd person role-playing games. This implementation is designed to to be use with Unity's PlayerInput component.

InputHub.cs is static class used to read input from anywhere. This simplistic approach works well for single player games, but will need rethinking for multiplyaer or co-op implementation.

This package is actively being worked on. Demo scenes, documentation, and prefabs are comming soon!
