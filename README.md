# Third Person RPG Input

## Introduction

This is a default configuration for Unity's New Input system that I use for my third person role-playing games. This implementation is designed to be used with the PlayerInput component.

This package includes InputHub.cs, which is a static class that can be read from anywhere. This simple approach works well for single player games, but will need rethinking for multiplyaer or co-op implementation.

This configuration uses two control schemes: Player and Menu.

Player,

Menu,

This package is actively being worked on. Demo scenes, documentation, and prefabs are comming soon!
